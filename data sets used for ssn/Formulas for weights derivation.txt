Notes for Mickey - 
Zipcode is not an attribute in our list - we are working with current location and previous places
Cross site identification is not making much sense because in the three sites we have, there are no preudonyms. Names would be enough across all three.
The ssn image is titled unknown. We need to cite it. Thai has mentioned this whole process in class so it seems to be popular its not new.
What are the stats backing up the ssn weights





Section 1 : Formulas and their Weights for cross site mapping

1. N > D > H > A > L > S (from the paper [1] and figure 7 from it) 
	L=1, A=2, H=10, Z=12, D=20, P=28, N=35, E=58

2. E > N (Since email IDs are unique)

3. Leakage is most for N > P > L > S > D > H

4. D + S + Z identifies 87% of US population ; and D + S + L identifies 53% of US population -> (from the paper [2])

5. Since sex is almost never variant among different profiles of the same user we can ignore it from our calculations without losing significant loss in the determination factor. ((from the paper [1] and figure 7 from it) )

6. From a single pseudonym alone, an attacker can figure out 40-17% of a user’s profiles, and 60-35% with multiple ones (these are obtained from the name N attribute which therefore leads to its huge weight) ((from the paper [1])

7. N + P > L + S + H + D + A + Z (Since name and profile pic is enough to identify between sites)

8. D + S + Z > 3.5 (L + A + H)

9. D + S + L > 1.5 (Z + A + H)

10. Using All the above formulas as input, and using paper [1]’s and figure 7 to compare between weights, we use the balance beam approach to come up with the following weights;	
	

Field 	Weight associated with cross site matching or linking


Email ID - E	0.35
Name	- N 0.21
Profile picture - P	0.17
Date of birth	- D -0.12
Zipcode	- Z - 0.07 
Hometown - H -	0.06
Age - A -	0.01
Location - L - 	0.01



Finding input's from paper [3], I'm trying to modify the weights so that name and profile picture should have less weight? 

Hamza has mentioned that we're going to keep the threshold at the name and profile picture, so their weight is not as significant. We'll use the other attribute weights to measure how much at risk a user's profile is.

From paper [3], we can give less weight to name (89% use the correct full name in all cases) and profile picture (only 80% are identifiable to some degree).

But we know we can assign more weight to DOB, Hometown, Number and due to their role in identifying the SSN of a user. Paper [3] (see explanation below.)

An additional re-identification risk lies in making birthdate,
hometown, current residence, and current phone number
publicly available at the same time. This information
can be used to estimate a person’s social security number
and exposes her to identity theft.

Zipcode

The first three digits of a social security number reveal
where that number was created (specifically, the digits are
determined by the ZIP code of the mailing address shown
on the application for a social security number). The next
two digits are group identifiers, which are assigned according
to a peculiar but predictable temporal order. The last four
digits are progressive serial numbers.

When a person’s hometown is known, the window of the
first three digits of her SNN can be identified with probability
decreasing with the home state’s populousness. When
that person’s birthday is also known, and an attacker has
access to SSNs of other people with the same birthdate in
the same state as the target , it is possible to pin
down a window of values in which the two middle digits
are likely to fall. 

The last four digits (often used in unprotected
logins and as passwords) can be retrieved through
social engineering. 

Since the vast majority of the Facebook
profiles we studied not only include birthday and hometown
information, but also current phone number and residence
users are exposing themselves to
substantial risks of identity theft.)

From the reasoning used above, DOB+HT can have more value since they’re the major factor for deducing the SSN information, and the cell number (M) and zip code (Z)/location (L) could have a lesser value .

Therefore, we have the equations and the weights derived from them as follows;

N > P > D = A = H > Z > L = M

D = A = H > 4 (Z = L = M) 

Therefore the weights for SSN risk are

Name	- N -  0.18 (Required for identification)
Profile picture - P - 	0.17 ((Required for identification))

Date of birth	- D - 0.17 (Primary for SSN identification)
Hometown - H -	0.18  (Primary for SSN identification)
Age - A -	0.17	(Primary for SSN identification)

Zipcode	- Z - 0.05   (Helping for SSN identification)
Cellphone number - M - 0.04 (Helping for SSN identification)
Location - L - 	0.04  (Helping for SSN identification)


Now we have two sets of weights, one for cross-site matching/linking, the other for SSN. We can assign about 30% for the cross site matching, and the 70% for the SSN risks.

Therefore the total risks associated to the weights are;

N .063 + .126 = .189
P .051 + .119 = .17

D .036 + .119 = .155
H .018 + .126 = .144
A .003 + .119 = .122

Z .021 + .035 = .056
M .028 = .028
E .105 = .105
L .003 + .028 = .031
